This code solves one of the biggest issues in using neural networks to classify and detect objects in any image. To do both classification and detection you usually need RCNN, not the much easier to get and train CNN. RCNN has many problems and issues and it is very hard to make its database and to train it.

But using this code you can use any CNN you create or a pretrained CNN like GoogleNet just as RCNN by extracting the CNN heatmap which is a great method to visualize how the CNN works.

The heatmap represents how much each pixel affects the decision of the classification using this we can get a bounding box around the ROI. Also you can even direct the CNN to look for a certain object inside the image with a very neat user friendly GUI as explained in the video.
